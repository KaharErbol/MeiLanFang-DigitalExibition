**Mei Lanfang** (梅兰芳) was one of the most famous and influential Peking opera performers in Chinese history. Born in 1894 in Beijing, China, he was known for his outstanding performances in the **dan** roles (female characters) despite being male, as it was traditional for men to play both male and female roles in Peking opera at that time. Mei Lanfang's performances were celebrated for their grace, beauty, and skill, and he helped popularize Peking opera internationally.

Throughout his career, Mei Lanfang modernized Peking opera by incorporating Western theatrical elements, expanding its reach and appeal. He performed worldwide, including in the United States, and Japan, making a significant impact on cultural exchanges.

Mei Lanfang is regarded as a national treasure of Chinese performing arts, and his legacy continues to influence Peking opera and Chinese cultural history to this day.
